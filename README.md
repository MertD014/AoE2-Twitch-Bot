A versatile Twitch chat bot designed for Age of Empires II streamers. It fetches real-time player stats from the `aoe2recs.com` API and includes a persistent, moderator-controlled scorekeeper to track wins and losses during a stream.

This bot is built to be lightweight, stable, and easily extensible.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- üìà **Stats:** Fetch current Ranked 1v1 and Team Game ELO with the `!elo` command.
- üèÜ **Persistent Scorekeeper:** Track your session's performance with `!score win` and `!score loss`. The score is saved to a file and survives bot restarts.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Moderator Controlled:** Critical commands like adding wins/losses and resetting the score are restricted to moderators and the broadcaster.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Efficient & Modern:** Uses `aoe2recs.com` API for fast data retrieval and runs API calls in a separate thread to ensure the bot never freezes.
